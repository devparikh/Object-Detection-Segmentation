# Object-Detection-Segmentation
This is a project that uses semantic segmentation used to identify object's in a self-driving cars environment. The model that is used to create this project is called a U-Net architecture model and the dataset that was uses was Cityscape from kaggle. After doing data augmentations in preprocessing.py I was able to get 23,800 training images and 4000 testing images from the original 3000 training images and 457 testing images.

This is the U-Net architecture.
